# The Football Game
The Football Game is my first small game developed with Unity.
The game is the solution to Mandatory II assignment for C# elective.

### Goal
In 'The Football Game' you have to score goals under the time limit (45 seconds).

### Commands
- WASD / Arrow Keys to move the player
- 'esc' to pause the game
- 'c' to switch camera perspective

## Levels

### Level 1
Is the tutorial. The pitch is smaller and there are no obstacles.
### Level 2
It has many static obstacles and the pitch is longer.
### Level 3
It has a mix of static and dynamic obstacles.

## Additional Features

### Progression
You cannot enter a level without having completed the previous level.
### The Streaker
A random event in level 3 where a streaker might cross the pitch.
### The multi-camera angle
Can switch between to cameras. The default camera will follow the ball, while the second camera will follow the player.
### The Time-Limit and record tables
Levels must be completed under 45 seconds. Once the level is completed the time taken to beat it will be saved and displayed in the scoreboard (visible in the main menu).
